Appliable fields is the only those ones that end with double semicolon and got an equal-colon sign in it. 
The newline symbol after 2x-semicolon does not matter for in-row comments possibility.
Do not write comments inside entries (after rows delimeters)!
It is legit if place such a fields everywhere, but the key of a field considered as a string of all the symbols preceding an colon-equal sign after 
the previous 2x semicolon or after the begining of a line.
If entries have the same names the previous ones ignored.
Spaces assume as delimiters of columns, commas + newline - of rows.
